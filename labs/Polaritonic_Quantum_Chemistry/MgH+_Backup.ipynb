    "## Polaritonic surfaces of MgH+\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "Nanostructured materials can be designed to strongly confine light down to nanoscale dimensions, which \n",
    "greatly enhances the energy density of light and increases the intera\n",
    "\n",
    "When molecules *strongly* interact with light, new quantum states, called polariton states, emerge that have\n",
    "properties of light and of matter.   Consider the image below where in Panel A a single molecule\n",
    "is contained in a cavity that strongly confines a single photon.  In the figure below, the cavity is imagined to\n",
    "confine a photon with electric field $\\vec{E}$ aligned with the transition dipole moment $\\vec{\\mu}_{i\\rightarrow f}$  connecting the ground to first singlet excited state of MgH+, where the energy of the trapped photon ($\\hbar \\omega$) matches this excitation energy in a particular region of the MgH+ potential energy surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data/MgH_polariton.png\" width=300 height=300 />\n",
    " \n",
    "Besides matching the photon energy to the energy of the molecular transition, the\n",
    "interaction energy between the photon and the molecule must be relatively large.  How do we compute the interaction energy?  We call the interaction energy $\\hbar g$ where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ g = \\vec{\\mu}_{i \\rightarrow f} \\cdot \\vec{E}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu_{mol}$ is the transition dipole moment between the molecular electronic ground state and\n",
    "the relevant molecular excited state, and ${\\bf E}$ is the electric field associated with the photon in the cavity.\n",
    "We demand that this energy must be large compared to the dissipation energy scale(s) of the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ g > \\frac{\\gamma_p + \\gamma_m}{4} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma_p$ is the inverse of the lifetime of the photon in the cavity and $\\gamma_m$ is the inverse of the lifetime of the relevant electronic excited state.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see, the excitation energy and transition dipole moment associated with the transition between \n",
    "two different molecular electronic states depends on the MgH+ bondlengty $R$.  This means that for a given cavity, certain regions of the molecular potential energy surface will be polaritonic in character, and other regions will not.  \n",

    "We will consider the diatomic cation MgH+ in a cavity chosen such that it can trap a photon with a \n",
    "frequency of $\\hbar \\omega = 4.3$ eV. \n",
    "We will compute the singlet ground state and first singlet excited state potential energy surfaces along the\n",
    "Mg-H+ stretch coordinate $R$ using time-dependent density functional theory.  We denote the ground \n",
    "state ket as $|g\\rangle$ with an associated energy eigenvalue $E_g(R)$, and the excited-state $|e\\rangle$\n",
    "with associated energy eigenvalue $E_e(R)$ where $R$ is the bondlength.  The transition dipole\n",
    "moment between $|g\\rangle$ and $|e\\rangle$ will also be computed using TDDFT, yielding $\\mu_{ge}(R)$. \n",
    "!!! Add sentence explaining what TDDFT is (briefly) and what it yields (excitation energies!)\n",
    "While\n",
    "the transition dipole moment and the electric field are vector quantities, in this case $\\mu_{ge}(R)$ is oriented along the internuclear coordinate ($R$), and so for simplicity we consider an electric field oriented soley along\n",
    "$R$ as well and treat both quantities as scalars.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider two quantum states for the photon - no photon in the cavity, denoted by $|0\\rangle$ with associated energy eigenvalue $\\frac{ \\hbar \\omega}{2}$\n",
    "and one photon in the cavity, denoted by $|1\\rangle$ with associated energy eigenvalue $\\frac{3 \\hbar \\omega}{2}$.  \n",
    "We will model this system with a generalized Rabi Hamiltonian that can be written as:\n",
