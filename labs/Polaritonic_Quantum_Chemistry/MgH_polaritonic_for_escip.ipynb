    "## Polaritonic chemistry for a simple diatomic molecule strongly interacting with light\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "Nanostructured materials can be designed to strongly confine light down to nanoscale dimensions, which \n",
    "greatly enhances the energy density of light and increases its interaction with molecular excitations.\n",
    "When molecules through their excitations *strongly* interact with light, new quantum states, called polariton states, emerge that have\n",
    "properties of light and of matter.   Consider the image below that shows the MgH+ molecule strongly \n",
    "interacting with a nanoconfined photon trapped between two parallel mirrors (aka a cavity). This cavity \n",
    "confines a photon with electric field $\\vec{E}$ aligned with the transition dipole moment $\\vec{\\mu}_{i\\rightarrow f}$  connecting the ground to first singlet excited state of MgH+.  When the energy of the trapped photon ($\\hbar \\omega$) matches this excitation energy in a particular region of the MgH+ potential energy surface, energy can be \n",
    "rapidly exchanged between the molecular excitation and the cavity.  We can think of this exchange as cylcing between  the molecule absorbing the trapped photon and becoming excited, and relaxing back to the ground-state and emitting the a photon which becomes trapped in the cavity.  When this cycling is rapid, as is the case when the interaction \n",
    "is strong, the cycling of energy makes it impossible to distinguish between the quantum state of the excited molecule and the quantum state of the photon localized in the cavity.  Rather, we think of this situation as a hybrid state that is part light part matter, and we call this state a polariton.  One fascinating feature of molecular polaritons\n",
    "is that their potential energy surfaces may be dramatically different than the potential energy surfaces of their\n",
    "molecular constituents.  Consequently, new and different chemical reactivity may be realized by putting molecules in cavities!  This notebook will explore the reshaping of the potential energy surfaces of the simple diatomic\n",
    "MgH+ by placing it in a cavity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data/MgH_polariton.png\" width=300 height=300 />\n",
    " \n",
    "Besides matching the photon energy to the energy of the molecular transition, the\n",
    "interaction energy between the photon and the molecule must be relatively large.  How do we compute the interaction energy?  We call the interaction energy $\\hbar g$ where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ g = \\vec{\\mu}_{i \\rightarrow f} \\cdot \\vec{E}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu_{mol}$ is the transition dipole moment between the molecular electronic ground state and\n",
    "the relevant molecular excited state, and ${\\bf E}$ is the electric field associated with the photon in the cavity.\n",
    "We demand that this energy must be large compared to the dissipation energy scale(s) of the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ g > \\frac{\\gamma_p + \\gamma_m}{4} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma_p$ is the inverse of the lifetime of the photon in the cavity and $\\gamma_m$ is the inverse of the lifetime of the relevant electronic excited state.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see, the excitation energy and transition dipole moment associated with the transition between \n",
    "two different molecular electronic states depends on the MgH+ bondlengty $R$.  This means that for a given cavity, certain regions of the molecular potential energy surface will be polaritonic in character, and other regions will not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model system\n",
    "We will consider the diatomic cation MgH+ in a cavity chosen such that it can trap a photon with a \n",
    "frequency of $\\hbar \\omega = 4.3$ eV. \n",
    "We will compute the singlet ground state and first singlet excited state potential energy surfaces along the\n",
    "Mg-H+ stretch coordinate $R$ using time-dependent density functional theory.  We denote the ground \n",
    "state ket as $|g\\rangle$ with an associated energy eigenvalue $E_g(R)$, and the excited-state $|e\\rangle$\n",
    "with associated energy eigenvalue $E_e(R)$ where $R$ is the bondlength.  The transition dipole\n",
    "moment between $|g\\rangle$ and $|e\\rangle$ will also be computed using TDDFT, yielding $\\mu_{ge}(R)$. \n",
    "!!! Add sentence explaining what TDDFT is (briefly) and what it yields (excitation energies!)\n",
    "While\n",
    "the transition dipole moment and the electric field are vector quantities, in this case $\\mu_{ge}(R)$ is oriented along the internuclear coordinate ($R$), and so for simplicity we consider an electric field oriented soley along\n",
    "$R$ as well and treat both quantities as scalars.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider two quantum states for the photon - no photon in the cavity, denoted by $|0\\rangle$ with associated energy eigenvalue $\\frac{ \\hbar \\omega}{2}$\n",
    "and one photon in the cavity, denoted by $|1\\rangle$ with associated energy eigenvalue $\\frac{3 \\hbar \\omega}{2}$.  \n",
    "We will model this system with a generalized Rabi Hamiltonian that can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    {\\bf H} =\n",
    "    \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "    E_g(R) +  \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "    0 & E_g + 3\\frac{ \\hbar \\omega}{2} &  \\lambda \\cdot \\mu_{ge}(R) \\\\\n",
    "    0 &  \\lambda \\cdot \\mu_{ge}(R) & E_e(R) + \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2}.\n",
    "    \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Procedure\n",
    "We will build and diagonalize this matrix across a range of bondlength values ($R$), and the \n",
    "resulting eigenvalues will comprise the polaritonic potential energy surfaces.  The resulting \n",
    "eigenvectors will comprise the polaritonic energy eigenstates.  We will utilize the `psi4` package to compute\n",
    "$E_g(R)$, $E_e(R)$, and $\\mu_{qe}(R)$ to be used in the model Hamiltonian above."
