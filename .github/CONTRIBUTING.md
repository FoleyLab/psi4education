Contributing to Psi4Education
=============================

We're so happy to hear that you're interested in contributing content
to the Psi4Education project!

Because we're developing educational materials for use in real college
classrooms, we have the unique challenge of keeping the bulk of our content
(instructor materials, answer keys, etc.) "private" so that students actually
have the opportunity to work on these exercises for themselves. To meet this
challenge, our organization has adopted a two-repository solution:
* `psi4education/psi4education`: Public-facing repository with all materials
necessary for students, and
* `psi4education/psi4education-instructors`: Private repository with all
instructor and student-centered materials.

To avoid accidentally making instructor materials publicly available in his
repository (`psi4education/psi4education`), we do not accept pull requests or
any other content contributions here. Instead, please contact one of the
repository maintainers, [Prof. Ashley
Ringer-McDonald](mailto:armcdona@calpoly.edu?subject=[p4edu%20GitHub]%20Psi4Education%20Instructor%20Access)
or [Dr. Dominic
Sirianni](mailto:sirianni.dom@gmail.com?subject=[p4edu%20GitHub]%20Psi4Education%20Instructor%20Access)
letting us know your affiliation, institutional e-mail address, GitHub
username, and a brief description of the course or courses where you would use
the Psi4Education resources, and we will invite you to collaborate on the
`psi4education/psi4education-instructor` repository.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
